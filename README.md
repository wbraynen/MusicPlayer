# MusicPlayer

This is an iPhone app.  It is a specialized music player for experiencing the albums posted at [pianowill.com](pianowill.com).

In other words, this is my pet project for learning the basics of Objective C :)

Screenshots of what I have implemented so far:

|MasterViewController|Detail, paused|Detail, playing|

# MusicPlayer

This is an iPhone app.  It is a specialized music player for experiencing the albums posted at [pianowill.com](pianowill.com).

The plan is to start with a mocked-up but functional player and then build on that.  Why not in Swift, you ask?  Oh man.

Screenshots of what I have implemented so far:

|MasterViewController|Detail, paused|Detail, playing|On last track|
